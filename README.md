# demo_app_qa_ML
This a small wikipedia web application that answers questions that you provide from an article
In this Application, we used Streamlit to build the User Interface and for the backend, we used the pretrained distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad model of HugginFace:
https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad.

## Others Requirements
* Transformers(pytorch-transformers and pytorch-pretrained-bert ): provides general-purpose architectures like XLM, DistilBert for Natrual Luanguage understanding
* Wikipedia Python library:  that makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia.
* Streamlit : an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. 

## App deployement: 

* We deploy the app using streamlit.io with github
